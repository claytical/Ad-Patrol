Advertisements.  In New York City, they are everywhere.  Companies pay other companies for the ability to market their goods to us.  Yet sometimes, the companies that sell the advertising space to companies with products don't actually own the space that they post their signs on.  Sometimes, that space is public property.  Do they have the right to do that?  If they have permits.  Do they have permits?  Not always.
</p>
<p>
In a place like New York, it's hard to blame the city officials for failing to regulate something that's so large and evasive.  <em>That's where you come in</em>.
</p>
<p>
You're mission, if you choose to accept it, is to document the advertising in your city.  We store every piece of evidence you report and hand it over to the Department of Buildings. Actually, we'll hand it over to anyone that wants it.
